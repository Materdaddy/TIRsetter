TIR DMX Address Setter
======================
This is a sketch I threw together for Arduino folks to set the DMX addresses on their TIR Systems Destiny CG Lights recently obtained by rfallatt and sold to the members of DIYC.

I take no credit for the work here.  This is due to the work of the following (in alphabetical order):
- airsouth
- chelmuth
- jklingert
- lightman
- mschell
- RavingLunatic
- rfallatt

I simply took what they found and wrote a simple DMX sender for arduino.

This is untested at this point.

The DMX code I based this off of came from here:
